You need more men.",

        "And I shall not forget it! , nor fail to reward that which is given. , Fealty with love. , Valour with honour. Disloyalty with vengeance. , I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences. Defences that your brother long held intact.",

        "South? But that will lead you past lsengard.",
        "Yes. Exactly.,If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.",
        "Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.",
        "Hurry.",

        "Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.,",
        "The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And.... ,And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin.",

        "I would have done, but our numbers were too few.",
        "That is not my intent.",
        "For Gondor!",
        "They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.",
        "You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.",
        "lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor.",
        "Gondor.",
        "It's dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

        "You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. I think not. ,I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not fail me.",

I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of all my numerous relations, you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.",
        "So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly. , They spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first light cracked open over the top of the trees.

        "I've no memory of this place",
        "Are we lost ?",
        "We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world",

        "Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.",
        "A storm is coming.",
        "This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin.",
        "Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next?",
        "Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city. , Help must come to us.",
        "But I know you have something to do with it.",
        "They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay. , The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent , dearer than the names of their sons. , Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. , The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.",
        "Why are they still guarding it?",
        "Mordor.",
        "Good gracious me!",
        "Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.",
        "Indeed?",
        "If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.",

        "Sam!",
        "I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to kill us!",
        "I'm not sending him away.",

        "We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.",
        "No",
        "I think we are",

        "I'm hungry",
        "There's something down there",
        "It's Gollum",

        "Gollum!",
        "He's been following us for three days",
        "He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r!",
        "Escaped , or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here , He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story , Yes , he was once called, before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad",
        "Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over. , The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many",
        "Good Evening little masters. What can I do for you ? If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized rooms available. Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ?",
        "Underhill, my name's Underhill",
        "Underhill , yes..",
        "We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've arrived?",
        "It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance",
        "What do we do now ?",
        "Sam. He'll be here. He'll come.",
        "What's that ?",
        "This my friend, is a pint!",
        "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.",
        "It comes in pints ?",
        "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way",
        "hmmmhmmm",
        "Gandalf ? ,Gandalf ? Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap! Big grey beard, pointy hat. , Not seen him for six months.",
        "So am I dear boy. , So am I.",
        "No thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!",
        "That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived!",
        "And what about very old friends?",
        "You've had a whole half already!",

        "It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?",
        "Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old as I am.",
        "Just tea, thank you.",

        "I'm on your side Mr Frodo",
        "I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol.",
        "I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn , I could only stand there, waiting.",
        "Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can.",
        "What are you doing?",

        "We must move on, we cannot linger.",
        "They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums , Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. , A shadow moves in the dark. , We cannot get out. They are coming.",

        "Frodo!",
        "No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.",
        "Fool of a Took! , Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!",
        "He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are. Wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but round here, he's known as Strider.",
        "Strider",
        "Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins! Baggins!",
        "Baggins ? Sure I know a Baggins! He's over there. Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his mother's side , and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me.",
        "Pippin!",
        "Steady on!",
        "Orcs!",
        "Get back! and stay close to Gandalf.",
        "Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he ?",
        "You cannot hide! , I see you! ,There is no life in the void , Only death!",
        "You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill!",
        "A little more caution from you! That is no trinket you carry!",
        "What do you want ?",
        "Oh!",
        "Just tea, thank you.",
        "Oh right. , You don't mind if I do, do you?",
        "Oh not at all!",
        "Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!",
        "I'm not at home! , It's the Sackville-Bagginses.",
        "I know you're in there!",
        "You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here, oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart , but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge cake! , I can make you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?",
        "Indeed , I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely That is a rare gift!",
        "I carry nothing",
        "So you mean to go through with your plan then?",
        "Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.",
        "You will tell him wont you?",
        "Pippin!",
        "He is here!",
        "I see you!",
        "Pippin!",
        "Help! Gandalf help!",
        "Help him!",
        "They're after the house! , They've never forgiven me for living this long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. , I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf. , And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!",
        "Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are made. , Oh, thank you.",
        "Pippin!",
        "No.",
        "Frodo suspects something.",
        "Fool of a Took!",
        "Look at me.",
        "Look at me! What did you see?",
        "They have a cave troll!",
        "Agh! Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.",
        "Pull!",
        "Gandalf, forgive me!",
        "Are you frightened?",
        "Yes",
        "Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?",
        "Let him go! Or I'll have you Longshanks!",
        "A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead. ,The city was burning.",
        "Who are you ?",
        "Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.",
        "You have a stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming",
        "Into the wild",
        "How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?",
        "I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel fouler.",
        "He's foul enough",
        "We have no choice but to trust him",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One , They will never stop hunting you.",
        "I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.",
        "Where are you taking us ?",
        "Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing.",
        "Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to remember.",
        "What are they ?",
        "He's very fond of you.",
        "What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?",
        "There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.",
        "He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.",
        "His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. , He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth , Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground , before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.",
        "Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?",
        "I will go!",
        "And what did you tell him? Speak!",
        "I saw' I saw him! , I could hear his voice in my head.",
        "He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me!",
        "No!",
        "They must be warned!",
        "But where is he leading us ?",
        "To Rivendell Master Gamgee. To the House of Elrond.",
        "D'you hear that! Rivendell! We're going to see the elves!",
        "Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall",
        "What about breakfast ?",
        "You've already had it",
        "We've had one yes. What about second breakfast ?",
        "Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin",
        "What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ? Supper! He knows about them, doesnt he ?",
        "I wouldn't count on it",
        "Pippin!",
        "They will be. , You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships. , Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith , and I wont be going alone.",
        "Where are we going?",
        "Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!",
        "Why did you look? Why do you always have to look?",
        "I don't know, I can't help it.",
        "And you? You're coming with me? , Merry?",
        "Come on!",
        "How far is Minas Tirith?",
        "Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies. And you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.",
        "Here, something for the road.",
        "The last of the Longbottom Leaf?",
        "I know you've run out. You smoke too much Pippin.",
        "I'm sorry alright? I won't do it again.",
        "But, we'll see each other soon?",
        "Wont we?",
        "Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here.",
        "I don't know! I don't know whats going to happen.",
        "Merry?",
        "You never can!",
        "Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste.",
        "Merry!",
        "Merry!",
        "He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get him out. Now he's gone. , Just like Frodo and Sam.",
        "One thing I've learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk.",
        "Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took!",
        "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.",
        "It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end… because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing… this shadow. Even darkness must pass.",
        "But in the end it’s only a passing thing, this shadow; even darkness must pass.",
        "It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.",
        "All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.",
        "You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and perilous.",
        "Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.",
        "Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.",
        "The burned hand teaches best. After that, advice about fire goes to the heart.",
        "It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.",
        "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.",
        "It is useless to meet revenge with revenge: it will heal nothing.",
        "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.",
        "Courage is found in unlikely places.",
        "It’s the job that’s never started as takes longest to finish.",
        "There is only one Lord of the Ring, only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power.",
        "His grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.",
        "It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because, how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad has happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand now. Folk in those stories has lots of chances of turning back, only they didn’t. They kept going, because they were holding on to something. That there is some good in this world, and it’s worth fighting for."
